# Tic-tac-toe

An assignment for the OOP section of Ruby Programming for The Odin Project to practice and showcase object oriented programming.

## [Play on Repl.it](https://repl.it/@HappyFrog/tic-tac-toe#bin/main.rb)

## Features

* A simple command line tic tac toe game for two players
* Works as you'd expect!

## Version History

V1 completed 26 / 5 / 2020.

## Future Updates

### Planned Features

* Add simple / random AI
* Add smarter AI
* Add ability to reset on end of game
* Add repl.it link
* Add slightly more polish, ie more detailed instructions, a welcome message etc

### Code Refactoring

* A pass on public / private methods
* Reduce size of Referee class?
* Separate objects into different files? DONE
* More efficient / clean implementation of win condition, smaller case statement

## Reflections

Output seems perfect, unsure about the quality of the input.

### Successes

Was finished reasonably quickly without too many major hiccups or bugs compared to how daunting the project seemed at the start - I learnt a lot of OOP techniques but was unsure where to start from a design standpoint. While I'm reasonably happy with the current implementation as a first attempt without much guidance I will need to study other programs to be able to properly assess it and what to improve.

### Challenges

Following on from the above, I'm unsure how good or bad the design is. It's hard to tell if it's simply procedural code wrapped in classes and objects. That aside I'm fairly sure my main class and object is somewhat bloated and should be stripped down into one or two more classes.

## Follow Up

* Look at the provided walkthrough and solution and compare to own implementation
* Seek feedback online / on discord
* Keep reading Sandi Metz book
